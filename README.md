# ANN-Overfitting-Lab
This project explores the impact of overfitting in artificial neural networks (ANNs) within the context of subsurface machine learning. By training an ANN on geospatial or petrophysical data, we investigate how model complexity, data size, and regularization techniques influence overfitting.
