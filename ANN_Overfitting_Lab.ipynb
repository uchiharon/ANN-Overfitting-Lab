    "## Introduction\n",
    "Would you believe me if I told you this entire project was built by *ChatGPT?* Your answer might be a confident “*Yes!*”—and I wouldn’t blame you. The truth is, while *ChatGPT* helped with a significant portion of the project, I was the one steering the ship.<br>\n",
    "Now pause and think: why are modern *Artificial Intelligence (AI)* systems so good at what they do? The answer lies in **Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs)**—*powerful models capable of learning from almost any kind of data*: tables, text, audio, video... You name it.<br>\n",
    "But here's the catch: like most *Machine Learning (ML)* models, **we want ANNs to learn meaningful patterns—not just memorize everything**. When a model starts learning **noise** instead of **general patterns**—*like learning the melody of a song versus memorizing every background sound*—it leads to a common issue called **overfitting**.<br>\n",
    "This project is designed to help you understand overfitting—*what it is, how to recognize it, and how to prevent it*—so you have something cool to say at your next dinner party (as Dr. Pyrcz would put it).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Executive Summary\n",
    "#### Gap:\n",
    "Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) are powerful tools for modeling nonlinear relationships in data, but they are also prone to overfitting—where the model performs well on training data but poorly on unseen data. This lab investigates the sensitivity of ANNs to architectural and training hyperparameters, and seeks to answer: What factors contribute most to overfitting in neural networks, and how can they be controlled?\n",
    "#### Approach:\n",
    "An interactive ANN model was implemented to simulate predictive regression tasks with synthetic noisy data. Various hyperparameters—such as number of epochs, dropout rate, number of hidden layers and nodes, learning rate, and batch size—were explored. Visualizations were used to demonstrate model performance under different settings, particularly observing overfitting patterns between training and testing results.\n",
    "#### Lessons Learned:\n",
    "-   Epoch count is a major contributor to overfitting—higher values often lead to memorization of training data.\n",
    "-   Dropout helps mitigate overfitting by randomly disabling nodes, though it may slightly increase prediction error.\n",
    "-   Constant-sized hidden layers promote overfitting compared to gradually reduced architectures.\n",
    "-   Learning rate plays a delicate role: if too high, the model may diverge or overfit quickly; if too low, it may underfit or train inefficiently.\n",
    "-   Model flexibility must be balanced with proper regularization to achieve good generalization.\n",
    "#### Recommendations:\n",
    "-   Apply early stopping or use lower epoch counts to prevent unnecessary training past the optimal point.\n",
    "-   Introduce dropout layers where appropriate to promote model robustness.\n",
    "-   Consider decreasing the number of hidden nodes in deeper layers to reduce model complexity.\n",
    "-   Tune learning rate carefully, potentially using learning rate schedules or search strategies to find the optimal value.\n",
    "-   Use visualization and validation performance as feedback loops to guide model adjustments iteratively."

    "#### Loss Function 📉\n",
    "A loss function quantifies the error between the predicted output of the neural network and the actual target value. During training, the network adjusts its weights to minimize this loss.\n",

    "🔧 General Idea:\n",
    "Let:\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Optimizers 🔁\n",
    "An **optimizer** in an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is the algorithm that **updates the model’s weights** during training to **minimize the loss function**. Its goal is to make the model learn by improving predictions step by step.\n",
    "\n",
    "At every training step:\n",
    "1. The model makes a prediction\n",
    "2. The loss function measures how far the prediction is from the actual value\n",
    "3. The optimizer adjusts the weights and biases to reduce this loss\n",
    "\n",
    "It uses gradients (from backpropagation) to decide how much and in which direction to change each parameter.\n",

    "#### Training Cycles\n",
    "A training cycle involves:\n",
    "- Presenting a batch of data to the model\n",
    "- Performing a forward pass to generate predictions\n",
    "- Calculating the prediction error\n",
    "- Applying backpropagation to update the model’s parameters and reduce the overall error\n",
    "- This process is repeated iteratively to improve model accuracy\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Batch\n",
    "A batch is a subset of the training data used in a single training cycle.\n",
    "\n",
    "There’s a trade-off in batch size:\n",
    "- Larger batches → More accurate error estimates, but increased computational cost per cycle\n",
    "- Smaller batches → Faster computation and potentially better generalization due to noisier updates\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Epoch\n",
    "An epoch consists of one full pass through the entire training dataset, broken into batches. Multiple epochs are typically required for a model to converge.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Connections\n",
    "Connections are the weighted links between nodes in adjacent layers of a neural network.\n",
    "In a fully connected (dense) network:\n",
    "- Each node in one layer connects to every node in the next layer\n",
    "- Each connection carries a weight that is adjusted during training to learn the optimal mapping from inputs to outputs\n",

    "## Observations\n",
    "[🔝 Back to Outline](#outline)\n",
    "1. **Model Performance (Top-Left Plot)**\n",
    "The ANN successfully learns the underlying trend in porosity prediction. The training and testing data generally follow the same trend, with minimal overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Loss Curves (Top-Center Plot)**\n",
    "The training and validation loss both decrease smoothly, indicating good convergence. However, the slight gap between them suggests mild overfitting as complexity increases.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Error Distribution (Top-Right Plot)**\n",
    "The error distribution for training and testing shows a small spread around the mean, confirming model stability. Yet, testing errors display a longer tail, highlighting some variance in generalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Hyperparameter Sensitivity (Bottom 6 Plots)**:\n",
    "    - **Epochs**: Error decreases with more epochs, then plateaus, showing that training for too few epochs leads to underfitting, while too many may not add value.\n",
    "    - **Hidden Nodes**: Increased nodes reduce error until diminishing returns or slight overfitting set in beyond ~100 nodes.\n",
    "    - **Hidden Layers**: Adding more layers initially improves performance, but after 3–4 layers, test error rises, showing increased overfitting.\n",
    "    - **Dropout Rate**: Moderate dropout (e.g., 0.1–0.2) helps regularize the model. Too much dropout leads to higher error.\n",
    "    - **Learning Rate**: Performance is sensitive to learning rate. Very small or large rates perform poorly. An optimal middle ground exists (~1e-3).\n",
    "    - **Batch Size**: Larger batch sizes lead to higher test error, indicating they may hurt generalization for this dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "This ANN Lab demonstrates the impact of model complexity and training parameters on overfitting and generalization. While increasing layers, nodes, and epochs can reduce training error, it must be balanced with regularization techniques like dropout and careful tuning of batch size and learning rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Pro Tip: Use sensitivity plots to visually compare different hyperparameter settings. Look for the point where test error is minimized and the gap between training and testing error is smallest — this helps you identify the sweet spot between underfitting and overfitting.**\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, this lab highlights the **importance of iterative tuning and validation** when developing ANN models for geoscientific applications like porosity estimation.\n",
